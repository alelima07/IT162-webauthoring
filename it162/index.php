        <h2>Hello, I'm Alessandra.</h2>
       <p>I was born and raised in the Amazon – Brazil! Yes, I love nature. Besides that, I’m also very interested in learning and experiencing a bit of everything that this world has to offer. I love to visit museums, historical places, and I watch games in the stadium. I love water sports such as swimming, snorkeling, and kayaking; and regardless of the weather where I am, aerobic classes and dancing are my favorite ones.</p>

       <h3>The purpose of this website</h3>

       <p>This website was made with a purpose to share my own experience as I learn Programming at Seattle Central College. As a matter of fact, I only starting falling in love with this field when I moved to Seattle and started connecting with many people who work in the technology field. I'm very excited to keep on learning and achieving my professional goals. </p>

       <h3>My purpose as a SCC student</h3>
       <p>I moved to the USA two years ago. Certainly the American culture has always drawn my attention and I’ve always had a great connection with American people. My positive point of view about the USA has been confirmed when I visited 16 states in the past two years. </p>
       <p>Now I feel the need to go back to school and pursue a degree in Computer Science. It’s about time to have a brief change in my lifestyle and focus on a career. A career in technology has its pros and cons, just like all jobs, but until now this is what I want for my life.</p>
